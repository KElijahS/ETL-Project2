## Starting Dataset
The first dataset is called [World of Pokemon](https://github.com/KElijahS/ETL-Project2/blob/main/Dataset/World_Pokemon_Clean.csv) by creator tensor. This dataset is the smaller of the two that we used, and its information is very concise and simple.

The second dataset is [Complete Pokémon Dataset](https://github.com/KElijahS/ETL-Project2/blob/main/Dataset/pokedex_421_Clean.csv) (Updated 16.04.21) by creator Mario Tormo Romero. This dataset goes much more in depth, and while it has good information, it is easy for a viewer to get lost very easily.

## Final Dataset
We decided to use the relational database, SQL, for our project. We felt that it allowed us more ability to do certain analysis and observation.
